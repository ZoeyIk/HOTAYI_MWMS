This solution is a FYP that is developed by me. 
It is a fully working application that can work on any Zebra devices, especially MC3300x Mobile Computer.

The functions of this application: 
1.  Scanning and the result is showed on input area (for receive, store, and issue)
2.  Able to show report on search, the input can accept scanned result
3.  Able to show warehouse map (grid map) based on data feteched from database
4.  Able to show the shortest path to target rack (can be done either user press the rack to navigate or user makes production requests)
